    * ! Getting Started with JavaScript
    
    * TODO: Primitive Variables in JS
        * * Integers
            *? Any whole number
            @example var num = 1;
        
        * * Strings
            *? A series of alpha-numeric characters wrapped in single or double  quotes.
            @example var name = "Mr. Nibbles";
            
        * * Boolean
            *? Either true(numerical rep of 1) or false(numerical rep of 0)
            @example var isJavaScriptFun = true;
    
    * TODO: Basic Data Sets in JS
        * * Arrays
            *? A collection of variables that are indexed from 0 to the end of the array.
            @example var arr = [1,2,3,4,5];

        * * Objects
            * ? A complex data set where we can hold multiple variables that relate to each other.
            @example var obj = {
                firstName: "Adrien",
                lastName: "Dion",
                age: 39
            }
    * TODO: Scoping and Hoisting
        * * 3 Levels of Scope
            * ? Global
            * ? Functional
            * ? Block
        
        * * Variables declared with the var keyword get hoisted up to the top of their scope
        
        * * If they are outside of a function, then they are global, if they are inside a function then they are functional.

        * * Variables declared with let and const are not hoisted.

    * TODO: Conditionals & Operators
        * * List of Math Operators
            * ?  + Addition
            * ?  - Subtraction
            * ?  * Multiplication
            * ?  / Division
            * ?  % Modulus
        
        * * List of Condiational Operators
            * ?  == Comparison of variable values only.
            * ?  === Comparison of variable value and type.
            * ?  <=  Less than or Equal to.
            * ?  >=  Greater than or Equal to.
            * ?  !  Not - or 'falsey'
            * ?  || Or statement
            * ?  && And statement
    * TODO: Functions
        * * Functions are blocks of reusable code.
        * * We define them as so
        * @example function add(num1, num2){
        *     return num1 + num2;
        * }
        *  * Return statements always end a function.
        *  * We can call the function as so
        *  @example add(2,3);
        * 
        * * We can also write them as arrow functions
        * 
        * @example const add = (num1,num2) => return num1 + num2;
        * 
        * * We would call it in the same way as a normal function.

    * TODO: DOM Manipulation
        * * JavaScript interperets the HTML file in an object form, hence the name Document Object Model.
        * * We can write functions within our script tags and set them to be called on html tags with event listeners.
        * * We can target elements on the page and assign them to variables.
        * @example var h1 = document.getElementById("banana");
